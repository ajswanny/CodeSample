This  directory features a code sample from an Android application that allowed
users to input a Twitter handle and be presented with an animated view of what
character from the *Star Wars* film franchise they were mostly related to.
Although the servers for this application are no longer reliable for
functionality (due to a limit of the AWS free-tier), the *machine-learning*
repository in this collection contains the code used on an AWS lambda to run the
machine learning functionality.
